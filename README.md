# Marton Varga's Portfolio Site

> 🧑‍🚀 **Built with Astro** 

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of an Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro is super streamlined and delivers great results for a web framework. I have a ton of fun developing frontends using Astro and I think it's the best way to built a static site. Don't use this as a starter template - Astro makes a great version itself! Use node package manager and start a new Astro project and try it out.
